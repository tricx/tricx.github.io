Site Specific Installation, 2018<br />
vlf antenna, audio modulated laser, solar-cell detector, loudspeaker<br />
Tuned City, organised by Carsten Stabenow<br />
Ancient Messene, Mavromati, Greece<br />

<br />
Natural radio frequencies, that are caused by meteorological phenomena, are transmitted by a laser through the Arcadian Gate of Ancient Messene and received on the other side of the walls by a detector. The detected sound is diffused by a loudspeaker and resonating through the gate.<br /><br />

The western Gate of Ancient Messene, called Arcadian Gate, is preserved in relatively good condition and since the time of the early travelers it has become the symbol of the city depicted repeatedly on engravings.
The Arcadian Gate is a monumental construction built of gigantic awe inspiring limestone blocks. Its shape is circular with two entrances, a double one in the interior and an external one, the latter being protected on either side by two square-shaped towers. The circular area inside the Gate has two niches, one on each side of the entrance where a Hermaic stele stood. God Hermes appears under his capacity as Propylaios, that is, the protector of Gates. Above the north niche one can read the following inscription: Κoιντος Πλώτιος Ευφημίων επεσκεύασεν Cointus Plotius Euphemion restored (the Gate).<br />

site specific research, happening 08:22am on may 12 2018<br />
Dashila Area Beijing<br />
4k video, binaural recording<br />
in cooperation with Jialin Yang and Micro Yuan’er, documentary crew with Xiang Nan / camera by Xie Chao<br />
made possible by Wan Lianxi letting fly his flock of pigeons, pigeonflutes by Wang Yongsheng<br />
with the support of Shayan, Yi-Chi Wang and TGIS
<br /><br />

The video shows a 360 degree scan of an Hutong area in Dashila, Beijing. It is considered a ‘red flight zone’, where the use of drones is prohibited due to the proximity to forbidden city and Tiananmen, Beijing. 
The old Hutong quarters are quite narrow and form a complex mesh of adaptions to the old traditional buildings, that organically grew over the years, that they have been open to the people. On some of the houses rooftops flocks of pigeons have their shelter. Those pigeons are mostly trained to participate in pigeon racings, and are therefore held with a lot of care, as pigeon racing turned out to be a gambling sport, that is also connected to wealthy people and yield high profits. It is said that the main goal for flight competition is not about money but honour, but there seems to be an evolving business going on with pigeon breeders, traders, pirating and betting offices. A worldwide market that evolved especially in China to unite economical, cultural, social and industrial interests to breed the best pigeons to achieve victories in the races. 
Besides this interest, there is the old tradition to let pigeons fly with special designed flutes, that get attached to the tail of the pigeons. Some of the flutes date back to the Qing dynasty and are still remade as collectibles to value the old handcraft. There are four types of whistles - tube, star, calabash and stareye types, that produce drone like tones up to pentatonic scales. When a flock of birds flies with the flutes attached, it appears as they mark a territory by circling in a certain orbit, diffusing the flute sound in a 3 dimensional spacial way.

Very low frequency signals (VLF-signals), which are can be caused by meteorological phenomena such as thunderstorms and lightning, were detected by a kite with an antenna and made audible through the use of a high sensitive transistor amplifier. The recordings were taken during a research trip in southern part of Chile and on Cape Horn.<br /><br />

<br /><br />

Among other things, the tour in the Magellan region in Chile dealt with the question of how places can be recorded in terms of sound, and whether topology can be taken as a starting point for experiments with sound. The route first went from Punta Arenas to Cerro Sombrero and Parque Karukinka in the Tierra del Fuego region and then by sea to Puerto Williams and Cape Horn, covering parts of the Strait of Magellan, which was discovered during the first circumnavigation of the world in 1520 and also sailed by Charles Darwin on the 1834 expedition on the HMS Beagle. The Magellan region in Chile is, on a global scale, a remote territory and only marginally populated. Of the indigenous peoples who used to live there, who were exterminated by diseases and planned expulsions, there is no comprehensive documentation available. Now, in addition to the large port facilities and the production stations of the state-owned oil company ENAP in the region around Punta Arenas, in the south at Puerto Williams mainly military bases, nature parks and sporadic tourist stations can be found. In between there are large uninhabited and inaccessible zones that can only be seen passing by with transport ships.<br />
The project Centre and Periphery picked up this field of tension in order to deal with the region and its topology abstractly and audibly. Based on the idea that all places are now decoded by modern communication technologies (geosatellites, radar, marine systems, measuring stations, ..) and are connected in a synchronized way in a global network, spatial specifics have been searched for signals that occur only in remote places and are otherwise inaudible. Following the meaning of periphéro "carrying around" (ancient greek: carrying around, environment,..), a mobile sculpture and measuring station was constructed in the form of a kite to pick up VLF signals. VLF signals are electromagnetic waves that are reflected by the ionosphere and triggered by meteorological phenomena such as thunderstorms or lightning. Persistent strong winds from the Antarctic and the extreme weather conditions on site were both a prerequisite, as well as theme for this project.

As a site specific intervention the Attractor is built in a public space, connects to its surroundings and reacts to changes in the electric field. In certain areas in Feijiacun, due to power poles and electrical substations, electric fields build up and can be detected with strip light. They are shaped by the constellations of the architectural setting. Different expansion is found on flat spaces, next to houses, near to trees or on rooftops. The sculpture is not connected to power, but lighted by the electric current it is surrounded by and detects the disturbances when people are passing. It deals with the processes happening in transitory areas and reveals signals that seem to be hidden from general perception.

<b>Flash, AM-Feld / Soviet Noise</b><br />
Audio Visual Installations / 2016/17<br />
radio, transmitter, electric current, camera flash, micro controller, relais, electromagnetic field<br /><br />

Flash is an audio-visual installation for camera flash, radio transmitter and changing electric current, shown in the last exhibition of Black Bridge artist village in Beijing, before it got abandoned due to re- structuring of the region. The flashes interfere with the electromagnetic field and thereby influence the signals detected by the radio receivers. The fluctuations of the power grid, which occur quite frequently in Beijing, push the radio transmitter out of resonance and produce an unstable field.<br /><br />


The project AM-Feld / Soviet Noise, is a cooperation with <a href="www.alexanderfelch.net/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color: grey"><i>Alexander Felch</i></a> which took place in St. Petersburg. It is the second part of the series ‘Triptychon of lost media’ and concerns the examination of emitter and receiver and explores extended techniques of sound generation and playback. The theme ‘emitter-receiver’ is the conceptual theoretical framework for the work series, but also correlates to the applied techniques of how sound and material are shaped. For ‘AM Field / Soviet Noise’ a radio signal was created to transmit 30 minutes of empty audio tapes, produced 1989. Portable radio receivers where supplied to detect the signals of the audio tapes from the ‘soviet environment’. The work is referencing russian protagonists like Velimir Khleb- nikov (author of the futuristic essay ‘radio of the future’), Alexander Stepanovic Popov (pioneer of radio technology) and UVB-76 (a short wave transmitter, sending a buzz tone since ~1975). There are several portable radio receivers in the room, whose position can also be changed by the visitors. The installation is based on the idea of the Acousmonium, a multi-channel loud- speaker sound system developed by Francois Bayle in the ‘Groupe de Recherches Musicales’ for Radio France 1974. But in contrast to the concept of a composition for fixed loudspeakers, the visitors, equipped with a portable radio receiver, are the players of a ‘loudspeaker orchestra’ themselves. They can move with the radio receivers in the zone of transmission. Several short- range transmitters, all at the same transmission frequency, are positioned at different locations in the room. Each transmitter covers a specific area, which can be received separately, but also modulated by possible interferences. The various transmission distances can be monitored by the movement in the space, thus resulting in a constantly changing configuration.

in cooperation with <a href="http://www.kunst-und-raederwerk.de/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color: grey"><i>Christoph Freidhöfer</i></a> <br /><br />

This is the first part of the series ‘Triptychon of lost media’. It deals with the examination of emitter and receiver and explores extended techniques of sound generation and playback. The theme ‘emitter-receiver’ is the conceptual theoretical framework for the work series but also correlates to the applied techniques of how sound and material is shaped.<br /><br />
Metal plates are used as tone generators as well as loudspeakers due to feedback that emerges from applying transducers and contact microphones to the surface. Due to the more or less chaotic vibration of the metal sheets and low amplification, the spectrum moves between the sound of fanfares and thunder. The installation deals with the propagation of sound in space and feedback between transmitter and receiver.<br />

The robot moves around the exhibition space, orienting itself based on the events, records the speech of other visitors and articulates clever sayings. Using its two parabolic microphone ‘ears’ with the help of the shielding function of the foam ‘hairstyle’ it listens to the most interesting events and moves in direction to where it suspects appealing things to happen. There the robot takes on its journey, remembering snippets of conversations. Otherwise it is striking sayings like ‘the most popular occupations for men and women’ or a quote from ‘Alte Meister’ by Thomas Bernhard.<br /><br />

Pachinko is played by more than 30% of the Japanese population. It is based on the coincidental spreading of Pachinko balls hitting certain positions, which lead to winnings. A peculiar feature in Pachinko game halls is the volume and the chaotically fluctuating sound. With this automaton the sound of the surroundings and the Pachinko itself is recorded, triggered, generated and manipulated in realtime without the use of prerecorded sounds (except one tribute-soundfile). Controlled by sensors, the Pachinko becomes an uncontrollable and absurd interface, as you never know what the machine will do next.<br /><br />

A toy police car falls in free fall at the exhibition Dimensions Variable # at Mo.ë. When the car is switched on, the car‘s flashing lights start flashing and it sounds: ‘Police, do not move - [sound- effect: gunshot] - you are under arrest!’ The car is equipped with a conductive cable on a coil that is attached to the ceiling. At random time intervals, the car falls from the ceiling to shortly before the impact on the ground.<br /><br />

- investigation and interaction with audio-visual material. Fragments of organisms such as lichens or tree bines and geological samples of a collection compiled by Claudia Larcher in the border region between Europe and Russia, on the Lithuanian peninsula Neringa, are categorized according to an abstract cartography. The material is re-arranged with the help of microscopes, contact microphones, coils, camera airbrakes, thus surveying the boundaries of scientific, geographical or geological aspects in a different context.<br /><br />

<p>
Site Specific Installation / 2008<br /><br />

The installation “Zweistimmige Inventionen” has been designed for the Prospekthof Semperdepot of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and consists of the following components:<br /><br />

A swing from a playground that was extended with hawsers (ropes) from the roof framework to the ground.<br />

A hi-fi system / ghetto blaster.<br />

The recordings of the fifteen Two-Part Inventions and one Three-Part Sinfonia of J.S.Bach, which I have learned for this work and recorded myself.<br />

A framed image that shows the wooden framework for a swing at a playground, where the swing is missing and the ground is covered with additional soil.<br />

Considerations to the themes, areas and associations, which could form some of the questions the Installation “Zweistimmige Inventionen” poses, are accompanying the work as a virtual art-theory handout.<br />

video (6mn 30)<br /><br />

The video shows the traces of the tires of a bicycle, during a ride through the city. The traces appear like oscillating lines that lay over the erratic movements and interferences of the structure of the ground. The audio track gives an anticipation of the urban surrounding, interferences between the noise of the pedals and the events on the street occur.<br /><br />
