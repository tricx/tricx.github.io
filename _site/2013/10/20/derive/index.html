<h4><a href="/2013/10/20/derive">Derive</a></h4>

<p>
2008<br />
Installation<br />
photography on baryt paper (copied from a super8 film)<br /><br />

During a research on the impact of architectonic structures in the city of Glasgow, I filmed one roll of super8 film, which shows outlying areas and seemingly abandoned housing projects. This film was later copied to negative film, reproduced as scene stills on baryt paper. They were shown as an arrangement in a light box with an additional external light bulb.<br /><br />

The technique the Situationists used to study urban areas is called psychogeography. The interaction of the researcher with the environment, architectural signs, specific regions or similarities of functional characteristics are tested, as the researchers draw an imaginary map with their motions and decisions - a kind of 'interactive motion parameter'.<br />
That means you have to expose yourself to random signs and let yourself be lead through them, to observe decision making (e.g. particularities that you are attracted to, which direction you choose etc.) to make both, individual operations, and the urban structure visible.<br /><br />

In connection with the implementation of the aesthetic components of modern architecture, which was already overruled at the time of the construction of the “high rise buildings” in Glasgow, the readability and interpretation of the signs there is different compared to historically grown towns. 
(As a model, housing projects in Marseille, realised from the plans of the architect Le Corbusier, provided a basis for this certain type of buildings in Glasgow.)
That also affects the possibilities of differentiation.
<br />
On the one hand side architecture proves as an archive of an economic and political condition at the date of its construction, then again asks for a 'transfer' into the actual time.<br />
Architecture is an object of the social conditions, as it assigns humans to their environment, structures interaction and proves the status of power. Despite the disappearance of all these uninhabited, decayed buildings and the restructuring of the urban sphere, those signs for the consequences of the 'efficiency' will be more covered in the future, and the implemented signs and codes will eventually shift, but won’t stop to show their impact.<br /><br />
