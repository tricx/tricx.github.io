photography on baryt paper, car paint, pages of the newspaper Bazar<br /><br />

Exhibition text:<br />
“Haiku“, writes Jack Kerouac, “was invented and developed over hundreds of years in Japan to be a complete poem in seventeen syllables and to pack in a whole vision of life in three short lines....above all, a Haiku must be very simple and free of all poetic trickery and make a little picture and yet be as airy and graceful as a Vivaldi Pastorella.“<br /><br />

Ancient ancient world<br />
–tight skirts<br />
By the new car<br /><br />

In opposition to this haiku, which was tagged on the wall, are several photographs referring directly to a place, although their documentary approach partly disappears.<br />

The different elements of the installation are tested on coherence and diverging analogies. The documentary elements are bound to a realistic representation, even though only the translation into the context of all parts sketches a picture. Intentions are hidden to the viewer at first sight and can only be reconstructed by individual associations of a possible conception.<br />

The titles of the images are taken form the newspaper Bazar, VW Bus T3, Toyota, Audi 80, VW Golf, Pickup (unknown) and also defined the value(price!) of the photographs itself.<br /><br />

Installation<br /><br />

The installation “Zweistimmige Inventionen” has been designed for the Prospekthof Semperdepot of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and consists of the following components:<br /><br />

A swing from a playground that was extended with hawsers (ropes) from the roof framework to the ground.<br />

A hi-fi system / ghetto blaster.<br />

The recordings of the fifteen Two-Part Inventions and one Three-Part Sinfonia of J.S.Bach, that I have learned for this work and recorded myself.<br />

A framed image that shows the wooden framework for a swing at a playground, where the swing is missing and the ground is covered with additional soil.<br />

Considerations to the themes, areas and associations, which could form some of the questions the Installation “Zweistimmige Inventionen” poses, are accompanying the work as a virtual art-theory handout.<br />

The video shows the traces of the tires of a bicycle, during a ride through the city. The traces appear like oscillating lines that lay over the erratic movements and interferences of the structure of the ground. The audio track gives an anticipation of the urban surrounding, interferences between the noise of the pedals and the events on the street occur.<br /><br />

photography, baryt paper (copied from a super8 film)<br /><br />

During a research on the impact of architectonic structures in the city of Glasgow, I filmed one roll of super8 film, which shows outlying areas and seemingly abandoned housing projects. This film was later copied to negative film, reproduced as scene stills on baryt paper. They were shown as an arrangement in a light box with an additional external light bulb.<br /><br />

The technique the Situationists used to study urban areas is called psychogeography. The interaction of the researcher with the environment, architectural signs, specific regions or similarities of functional characteristics are tested, as the researchers draw an imaginary map with their motions and decisions - a kind of 'interactive motion parameter'.<br />
That means you have to expose yourself to random signs and let yourself be lead through them, to observe decision making (e.g. particularities that you are attracted to, which direction you choose etc.) to make both, individual operations, and the urban structure visible.<br /><br />

In connection with the implementation of the aesthetic components of modern architecture, which was already overruled at the time of the construction of the “high rise buildings” in Glasgow, the readability and interpretation of the signs there is different compared to historically grown towns. 
(As a model, housing projects in Marseille, realised from the plans of the architect Le Corbusier, provided a basis for this certain type of buildings in Glasgow.)
That also affects the possibilities of differentiation.
<br />
On the one hand side architecture proves as an archive of an economic and political condition at the date of its construction, then again asks for a 'transfer' into the actual time.<br />
Architecture is an object of the social conditions, as it assigns humans to their environment, structures interaction and proves the status of power. Despite the disappearance of all these uninhabited, decayed buildings and the restructuring of the urban sphere, those signs for the consequences of the 'efficiency' will be more covered in the future, and the implemented signs and codes will eventually shift, but won’t stop to show their impact.<br /><br />

super8-loop (3mn10)<br /><br />

The concept for both Super8 Film and Installation settings was developed and realised for one of the rooms of the bunker Flakleitturm Arenbergpark in Vienna.<br />

The film loop shows permanently turning maple seeds, in density and speed variable. The projection can be seen from everywhere in the room on a transparent canvas.<br />
