Composition for violin, grains on a metal surface and live-electronics ~8‘ , 2012<br />
[violin is played by Barbara Lüneburg, recorded at Echoraum, Wien]<br /><br />

The piece consists of singular tones that fill the space horizontally and create a quiet ubiquitous drone. Filtered noise areas, quiet creak, some prominent sound particles, (no open strings), minimal timbre (out of a grayscale evolve „colours“), microtonality vs. widely spaced intervals, grains, ..<br />Notation:<br />
The pitch of the violin results from the vertical position of the note within the score; i.e. high frequencies - low frequencies. The timeframe is also relative. The task of the electronics is to extract individual sections from the played parts of the violin and to filter them slightly by means of pitch shift or granular synthesis. Due to the division into 4 channels there are focal points, but they are selected loosely. The notation makes suggestions for this, but these are understood as indications.
