several contributions to the curatorial/artistic <a href="http://www.transienthole.net/" target="_blank">Transient Hole (Variations)</a>
project proposed by Alexander Felch<br />
<br />
<b>Kanaldeckel</b><br />
found / removed object, 2017/18<br />
cooperation with Karl Salzmann<br />
for the exhibtion Transient Hole at Zentrale, Vienna<br />
<br />
Kanaldeckel is referring to an action that is needed to explore a different layer within the urban landscape, and could stand for an entrance point moving to another dimension in space. Following the slogan: “Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand”, a manhole was transferred from its original position, to create a gateway to stroll around for some time.

After hacking into the radio frequency of the Mercedes Benz car, available at Antwerp gallery fp24, this mobile soundsystem was used to diffuse hidden frequencies, HF-and VLF-signals, and modulated low oscillations.

AM Feld / Soviet Noise
</b>
<br />
This is the second part of the series 'Triptychon of lost media'. It concerns the examination of emitter and receiver and explores extended techniques of sound generation and playback. The theme emitter / receiver is the conceptual theoretical framework for the work series but also correlates to the applied techniques of how sound and material is shaped.
<br /><br />
For 'AM Field / Soviet Noise' a radiosignal was created to transmit 30 minutes of empty audio tapes, produced 1989. Portable radio receivers where supplied to detect the signals of the audio tapes from the 'soviet environment'. In cooperation with <a href="www.alexanderfelch.net/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color: grey"><i>Alexander Felch</i></a>
