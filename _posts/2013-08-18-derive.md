Installation<br />
/ photography on baryt paper (copied from a super8 film)<br /><br />

Starting with a research on the impact of architectonic structures in the city of Glasgow, I filmed one roll of super8 film, which shows outlying regions and seemingly abandoned housing projects. This film was later copied to negative film, reproduced as film stills on baryt paper and shown in a light box with an additional external light bulb as an installation.<br /><br />

The technique the Situationists used to study urban areas is called psychogeography. The interaction of the researcher with the environment such as architectural signs, specific regions or similarities of functional characteristics is investigated as they draw an imaginary map with their motions and decisions as a kind of interacting motion parameter.<br />
That means you have to expose yourself to random signs and let yourself be lead through them, to observe decision making (like which direction you choose or what particularity one is to gather) to make both, individual operations, and the urban structure visible.<br /><br />

In connection with the implementation of aesthetic components the architecture of modernity uses, which was already departed at the time of the construction of the “high rise buildings”, (as a model, housing projects in Marseille, realised from the plans of the architect Le Corbusier, provided a basis for this certain type of buildings in Glasgow), the organisation of the readability and interpretation of the signs there is different to other slower grown and historical towns, what also affects the possibilities of differentiation.<br />
On the one hand side architecture as an archive of an economic and political condition at the date of construction is ascertainable, then again almost asks for a concurrent attempt for an actual time consideration.<br />
I also think, that despite all these uninhabited, decayed and demolition approved buildings and the restructuring of the urban sphere, the potential of the efficacy in the future will be more covered, and the implemented signs and codes could eventually shift, but won’t stop to show impact.
