Pachinko is played by more than 30% of the Japanese population. It is based on the coincidental spreading of Pachinko balls hitting certain positions, which lead to winnings. A peculiar feature in Pachinko game halls is the volume and the chaotically fluctuating sound. With this automaton the sound of the surroundings and the Pachinko itself is recorded, triggered, generated and manipulated in realtime without the use of prerecorded sounds (except one tribute-soundfile). Controlled by sensors, the Pachinko becomes an uncontrollable and absurd interface, as you never know what the machine will do next.<br /><br />
