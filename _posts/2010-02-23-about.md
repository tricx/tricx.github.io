Paul GRÜNDORFER explores sound as perceptional phenomena of action and reaction to site specific criteria. His works focus on processes that evolve within a space, where sound is considered not solely as an abstract medium, but also directly connects to, influences and mirrors the environment, and is therefore happening in the realm of social spheres. They deal with the instability of systems, questioning the role of control and reaction, and search for mechanisms that might be primarily hidden.

Paul Gründorfer is using process-related setups to explore sonic worlds and to realise site specific interventions, developing real time audio systems, that act autonomous or in reference to the spatial constellation. While considering the encounters between analog and digital, structured or improvised elements, he is focusing on the abstract occurrence of sound and its physical impact.<br />
Electronic circuits are interconnected to cause semi-natural entities, autonomous organisms. Voice and articulation are generated through loops in feedback networks. Onomatopoeia.<br />
His artistic activities examine variable connections between transmitter-receiver networks, which function as a conceptual framework for experimentation with sound and transmission of information.




Artistic activities examine the connections of acoustic and visual transmitter - receiver networks. The topic transmitter - receiver is assumed as a conceptual framework for process-related experiments with of sound, light and transmission of information, but also refers to the applied research methods.

At the moment I am mainly working and experimenting with sound, in the areas of experimental electronic music, sonic sculpture and site specific intervention. I am developing real time audio systems, that act autonomous or in reference to the spatial constellation. While considering the encounters between analog and digital, structured or improvised elements, I focus on the abstract occurrence of sound and its physical impact.
Electronic circuits are interconnected to cause semi-natural entities, autonomous organisms. Voice and articulation are generated through loops in feedback networks. Onomatopoeia. The spectrum of sound is found in the present.
