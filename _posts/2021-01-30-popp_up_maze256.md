The arcade game Pac-Man is the starting point of the site-specific intervention Popp-Up-Maze 256. The video game marks the transition from electromechanical to computer-controlled slot machines in 1980, making it one of the first games to move from a real to virtual space. It could mark the start in a simulated world.

The playing area of the game is transferred to the Eduard-Popp-Hof. The warp mode known from Pac-Man, the moment of exiting and simultaneously entering on the other side of the playing field, spreads within the Eduard Popp settlement. In "Pop-Up-Maze 256" the warp, which is placeless and timeless in the game, becomes a walk-in space, an expanded city playing field, in which symbols and protagonists from the arcade game can be found, which are visually oriented to floor markings at construction sites and road works. The intervention is also an offer to follow the signs of the city.
