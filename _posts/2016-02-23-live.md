At the moment I am mainly using process-related setups to explore sonic worlds and to realise site specific interventions. I am developing real time audio systems, that act autonomous or in reference to the spatial constellation.While considering the encounters between analog and digital, structured or improvised elements, I am focusing on the abstract occurrence of sound and its physical impact.<br />
Electronic circuits are interconnected to cause semi-natural entities, autonomous organisms. Voice and articulation are generated through loops in feedback networks. Onomatopoeia.<br />
Artistic activities examine the connections of acoustic and visual transmitter - receiver networks. The topic transmitter - receiver is assumed as a conceptual framework for process-related experiments with of sound, light and transmission of information, but also refers to the applied research methods themselves.

At the moment I am mainly working and experimenting with sound, in the areas of experimental electronic music, sonic sculpture and site specific intervention. I am developing real time audio systems, that act autonomous or in reference to the spatial constellation. While considering the encounters between analog and digital, structured or improvised elements, I focus on the abstract occurrence of sound and its physical impact.
Electronic circuits are interconnected to cause semi-natural entities, autonomous organisms. Voice and articulation are generated through loops in feedback networks. Onomatopoeia. The spectrum of sound is found in the present.
