MONO-NO-KE is part of a series of works that deal with the transmission of sound and appearance of sound events relational to space.
It draws it‘s starting point from observations in the Sumida area in Tokyo, where full plastic water bottles standing next to the houses, manufacturers, hidden in the corners or in the front of stores, seem to be used as an everyday custom to scare cats and beasts away, apparently a neko-yoke.
It is also connected to the japanese belive of Mononoke and Yokai, which seem to combine imaginary and scientific explanation about natural phaenomena and ghost like appearances, and connect 1000 year old stories, with current sci-fi, manga and game culture.<br />
Reflections and Refractions of a laser that scans plastic bottles are translated to sound through interpretation of the refracted light. Sound is is not generated but shaped to the appearance in space. Refracted by the laser, detailed but ever changing shapes appear. Those images are captured by a web-camera and translated via an ‘ifft process’ (inverse frequency analysis) which results in an audible synthesised sound.
